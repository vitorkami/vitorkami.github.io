My fieldwork spans a wide range of Neotropical ecosystems, from humid forests to seasonally dry and open vegetation, including:

-   **Atlantic Rainforest** – from lowland to montane forests along elevational gradients\
-   **Amazonian forests** – intact and human‑modified tropical forests\
-   **Cerrado** – savanna and forest–savanna transitions\
-   **Caatinga** – seasonally dry tropical forests and shrublands\
-   **Amazonian cangas** – ferruginous rocky outcrops under extreme edaphic and climatic conditions\
-   **Inselbergs** – both continental and coastal/maritime rocky outcrops, hosting highly specialized and often endemic plant communities

Across these systems, I combine vegetation surveys, demographic monitoring, experiments and trait measurements to understand how environmental gradients, disturbance and insularity shape plant communities and plant interactions.
