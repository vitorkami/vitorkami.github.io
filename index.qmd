### Hi, I'm Vitor 👋

I am a plant ecologist fascinated by the diversity of tropical ecosystems and by life’s capacity to
persist in extreme environments. My research integrates evolutionary, functional, and spatial
ecology to uncover the mechanisms that generate, maintain, and organize biodiversity, and to
understand how ecological and evolutionary processes interact across scales in space and time.

In my work, I integrate:

- field sampling and experiments  
- long-term monitoring  
- laboratory experiments and trait measurements  
- statistical analysis and modelling in **R**

## From Atlantic and Amazonian forests to inselbergs and islands

My fieldwork ranges from Atlantic and Amazonian forests to Cerrado, Caatinga, Amazonian cangas and both continental and coastal inselbergs, where I study how environmental gradients, disturbance and insularity shape plant communities and interactions.
