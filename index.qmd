### Hi, I'm Vitor 👋

I am a plant ecologist fascinated by the diversity of tropical ecosystems and by life’s capacity to
persist in extreme environments. My research integrates evolutionary, functional, and spatial
ecology to uncover the mechanisms that generate, maintain, and organize biodiversity, and to
understand how ecological and evolutionary processes interact across scales in space and time.

In my work, I integrate:

-   field sampling and experiments

-   long term studies

-   laboratory experiments and trait measurements

-   statistical analysis and modelling in **R**\
