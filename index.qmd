Ecologist interested in how **insularity**,  and **community dynamics** shape biodiversity in rocky outcrops and other Neotropical ecosystems.  
I combine **intensive fieldwork** with **statistical modelling in R**, with a focus on reproducible research.

### Hi, I'm Vitor 👋

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Ecology at [Your Institution] (update this), studying how **insularity** affects seed dispersal, interaction networks, and community structure in [your study systems: inselbergs, rocky outcrops, islands of vegetation, etc.].

In my work, I integrate:

- field sampling and experiments  
- statistical analysis and modelling in **R**  
- open and reproducible workflows (code + data)

## Research interests

### 🌱 Insularity and community dynamics

How habitat islands (e.g., rocky outcrops / inselbergs) influence:

- species composition and community structure  
- colonization–extinction dynamics  
- connectivity between habitat patches

### 📊 Ecological modelling in R

- Linear and mixed-effects models  
- Community and network models  
- Reproducible workflows: code and data released on [GitHub](https://github.com/vitorkami)  
  and linked to each paper in [Publications](publications.qmd)
