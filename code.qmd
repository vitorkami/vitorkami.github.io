title: "Code & Reproducible Workflows"
---
::: {.text-card}
My research involves code at many stages of the scientific process, from data collection to publication‑ready figures.  
I work mainly in **R**, combining classical statistical approaches with modern computational tools.

I am interested in:

- building and curating **data sets** from field, herbarium and environmental data  
- performing **classical statistical analyses** (GLMs, mixed models, multivariate analyses, etc.)  
- developing and applying **machine learning algorithms** for ecological and biogeographical questions  
- designing **figures and visualisations** that communicate results in a precise, clear and aesthetically pleasing way  
- implementing **reproducible workflows**, integrating data, code and documentation in transparent pipelines

Soon this page will host links to the GitHub repositories associated with my manuscripts and ongoing projects.
