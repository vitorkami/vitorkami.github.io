I am a plant ecologist fascinated by the diversity of tropical ecosystems and by life’s capacity to persist in extreme environments. My research integrates evolutionary, functional and spatial ecology to uncover the mechanisms that generate, maintain and organize biodiversity, and to understand how ecological and evolutionary processes interact across scales in space and time. I am also engaged with political ecology, critically examining neo‑colonial narratives in conservation biology and their implications for biodiversity governance and scientific practice.

In my work, I integrate:

- field sampling and experiments  
- long-term monitoring  
- laboratory experiments and trait measurements  
- statistical analysis and modelling in **R**

## Personal story

::: {.personal-story}
I grew up in São Paulo, and my first contact with tropical forests came through the Atlantic Forest. During my undergraduate and graduate years at UNESP, I became increasingly interested in how ecological theory, field ecology and political debates over land, conservation and neo‑colonial narratives intersect in real landscapes.

Today, my work in UNICAMP at [LEEG Laboratory](https://www.instagram.com/leeg.unicamp/){.inline-link} continues to be shaped by these experiences, combining long-term monitoring, collaboration with local researchers and communities, and critical perspectives on how conservation decisions are made.
